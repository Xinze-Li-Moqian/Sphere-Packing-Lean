# Theorem — thm:periodic-packing-optimal

## Statement

> [!theorem] thm:periodic-packing-optimal
> For all $d$, the [[def-periodic-sphere-packing-constant|periodic sphere packing constant]] in $\mathbb{R}^d$ is equal to the [[spherepackingconstant|sphere packing constant]] in $\mathbb{R}^d$.

## Proof

> [!note]- Proof (click to expand)
> The following proof was written by Junyan Xu in the thread for [Issue \#80](https://github.com/thefundamentaltheor3m/Sphere-Packing-Lean/issues/80) of the repository.
> 
> Given an arbitrary packing $P$ of upper [[spherepackingdensity|density]] $\Delta$ and an arbitrary $\epsilon > 0$, we want to produce a [[periodicspherepacking|periodic packing]] with density at least $\Delta - \epsilon$. Given a set $S$ (of nonzero volume), we shall call the quantity $\frac{\left| S \cap P \right|}{\left| S \right|}$ the density of $P$ in $S$, where $\left| S \right|$ denotes the volume of $S$.
> 
> Choose $\ell > 0$ such that
> 
> $$\frac{(\ell - 4r)^d}{\ell^d} > 1 - \frac{\epsilon}{3}$$
> 
> (where $r$ is the radius of the balls in $P$ and $d$ is the dimension). Then choose $R_0 > 0$ such that for all $R > R_0$, we have
> 
> $$\frac{\left( R + \sqrt{d}\,\ell \right)^d - \left( R - \sqrt{d}\,\ell \right)^d}{R^d} < \frac{\epsilon}{3}$$
> 
> By definition of upper density, there exists $R > R_0$ such that the density of $P$ in $B(0,R)$ is at least $\Delta - \frac{\epsilon}{3}$.
> 
> The Euclidean space is covered by disjoint hypercubes of side length $\ell$ of the form $\prod_{i=1}^d \left[ n_i\ell, (n_i+1)\ell \right)$ with $n_i \in \mathbb{Z}$. Since these hypercubes have diameter $\sqrt{d}\ell$, those that intersect $B(0,R)$ must be contained in $B(0,R+\sqrt{d}\ell)$. Thus the hypercubes contained in $B(0,R+\sqrt{d}\ell)$ cover $B(0,R)$. Similarly, the hypercubes not contained in $B(0,R)$ cannot intersect $B(0,R-\sqrt{d}\ell)$. Denote the union of hypercubes contained in $B(0,R+\sqrt{d}\ell)$ by $T$ and the union of those contained in $B(0,R)$ by $S$, we then have
> 
> $$S \subseteq B(0,R) \subseteq T \subseteq B(0,R+\sqrt{d}\ell)$$
> 
> and
> 
> $$T \setminus S \subseteq B(0,R+\sqrt{d}\ell) \setminus B(0,R-\sqrt{d}\ell)$$
> 
> The density of $P$ in $S$ is
> 
> $$\begin{aligned}
> \frac{\left| S \cap P \right|}{\left| S \right|}
> &\ge \frac{\left| B(0,R) \cap P \right| - \left| B(0,R) \setminus S \right|}{\left| B(0,R) \right|} \\
> &> \left( \Delta - \frac{\epsilon}{3} \right) - \frac{\left| T \setminus S \right|}{\left| B(0,R) \right|} \\
> &> \left( \Delta - \frac{\epsilon}{3} \right) - \frac{\epsilon}{3}
> \end{aligned}$$
> 
> Therefore, the density of $P$ in some hypercube $C \subseteq S$ is at least $\Delta - \frac{2\epsilon}{3}$. If a ball in $P$ (thus of diameter $2r$) is not completely contained in $C$, it cannot intersect the hypercube $C'$ with the same center as $C$ with side length $\ell-4r$, so excluding these balls from $C\cap P$ decreases the density in $C$ by at most $\frac{\left| C \setminus C' \right|}{\left| C \right|} = \frac{\ell^d - (\ell-4r)^d}{\ell^d} < \frac{\epsilon}{3}$, and gives rise to a periodic packing of density $> \Delta - \epsilon$ with $C$ as a fundamental domain.

# Lemma — lemma:lattice-points-bound

## Statement

> [!lemma] lemma:lattice-points-bound
> For all $R$, we have the following inequality relating the number of [[iszlattice|lattice]] points from $\Lambda$ in a ball with the volume of the ball and the fundamental region $\mathcal{D}$:
> 
> $$\frac{\mathrm{Vol}(\mathcal{B}_d(R - L))}{\mathrm{Vol}(\mathcal{D})}
> \leq \left|\Lambda \cap \mathcal{B}_d(R)\right|
> \leq \frac{\mathrm{Vol}(\mathcal{B}_d(R + L))}{\mathrm{Vol}(\mathcal{D})}$$

## Proof

> [!note]- Proof (click to expand)
> For the first inequality, it suffices to prove that $\mathcal{B}_d(R - L) \subseteq \bigcup_{x \in \Lambda \cap \mathcal{B}_d(R)} (x + \mathcal{D})$, since the cosets on the right are disjoint. For a vector $v \in \mathcal{B}_d(R - L)$, we have $\|v\| < R - L$ by definition. Since $\mathcal{D}$ is a fundamental domain, there exists a lattice point $x \in \Lambda$ such that $v \in x + \mathcal{D}$. Rearranging gives $v - x \in \mathcal{D}$, which means $\|v - x\| \leq L$. By the triangle inequality, $\|x\| < R$, i.e. $x \in \mathcal{B}_d(L)$, concluding the proof.

> For the second inequality, we prove that $\bigcup_{x \in \Lambda \cap \mathcal{B}_d(R)} (x + \mathcal{D}) \subseteq \mathcal{B}_d(R + L)$. Consider a vector $x \in \Lambda \cap \mathcal{B}_d(R)$ and a vector $y \in x + \mathcal{D}$. From above, we know $\|x\| < R$ and $\|y - x\| \leq L$, so $\|y\| < R + L$, concluding the proof.
